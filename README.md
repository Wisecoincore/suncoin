SunCoin (SUN)
===========

Let there be light: and there was light.
With humans colonizing everything there is one planet they will never crush - Sun.
Sun gives life and SUN cannot be touched by anything. This is one of reasons in ancient Egypt and all other cultures there were cults of Sun and its Gods were most important.
Now in our crypto-world we have something important that touches its base - SUN Coin.
